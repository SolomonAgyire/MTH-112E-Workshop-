Instructions: Use your class notes and the synthetic division process to find the quotient and the remainder. Be careful when dealing with missing terms. 

 

Problem Q1: Divide f(x) = x³ - 4x² - 17x + 60 by d(x) = x - 5.

Hint: The value of c you use in the box is 5.

Step-by-step Solution:  

Step 1 — Set up: Use the divisor c = 5 (opposite sign of x-5) and coefficients: 1, -4, -17, 60

Step 2 — Divide: Perform synthetic division:
    Bring down 1
    Multiply 1 × 5 = 5, add to -4 → 1
    Multiply 1 × 5 = 5, add to -17 → -12
    Multiply -12 × 5 = -60, add to 60 → 0

Step 3 — Result: The resulting depressed polynomial is Q(x) = x² + x - 12. The Remainder is R = 0.

Solution Check: Q(x) = x² + x - 12, R = 0.

Common Error & Note: Students must remember to use the opposite sign of the divisor. For (x-5), use c = 5, not c = -5.

 

Problem Q2: Divide f(x) = 2x⁴ + 5x² - 1 by d(x) = x + 1.

Hint: Remember to insert 0 for the missing x³ and x terms in your synthetic division setup. The value of c is -1.

Step-by-step Solution:  

Step 1 — Set up: Use the divisor c = -1 (opposite sign of x+1) and coefficients: 2, 0, 5, 0, -1 (must include placeholders for x³ and x).

Common Error: Forgetting to include 0 placeholders for missing terms like x³ and x.

Step 2 — Divide: Perform synthetic division:
    Bring down 2
    Multiply 2 × (-1) = -2, add to 0 → -2
    Multiply -2 × (-1) = 2, add to 5 → 7
    Multiply 7 × (-1) = -7, add to 0 → -7
    Multiply -7 × (-1) = 7, add to -1 → 6

Step 3 — Result: The resulting depressed polynomial is Q(x) = 2x³ - 2x² + 7x - 7. The Remainder is R = 6.

Solution Check: Q(x) = 2x³ - 2x² + 7x - 7, R = 6.

Note: Students must be reminded that the dividend is 2x⁴ + 0x³ + 5x² + 0x - 1.

Instructions 

Students work in groups to find all zeros of the polynomial. Follow the specific steps below. 

 

Problem A: Find all zeros of f(x) = x³ - 7x - 6.

Step-by-step Solution 

Common Error & Note 

Step 1: Rational Zero Theorem (P/Q): List all possible rational zeros. P = factors of -6 and Q = factors of 1

Possible rational zeros: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6

Step 2: Synthetic Division (Test c = -1): Use coefficients: 1, 0, -7, -6 (placeholder for x² is required). 

Step 3: Factor Theorem: Since the remainder is 0, (x+1) is a factor.

Common Error: Students forget to switch the sign (i.e., if c = -1, the factor is x+1).

Step 4: Depressed Polynomial: The quotient is x² - x - 6.

Note: The problem reduces to solving the quadratic equation x² - x - 6 = 0.

Step 5: Factor and Solve: Factor the depressed polynomial: (x-3)(x+2) = 0. Solutions are x = 3 and x = -2.

Final Zeros: {-1, 3, -2}.

Instructions 

Use Descartes' Rule of Signs to determine the possible number of positive, negative, and imaginary zeros for the polynomial. 

 

Problem: Use Descartes' Rule of Signs for f(x) = x⁵ - 2x⁴ + 3x³ + x² - 5x + 1.

Analysis 

Calculation 

Positive Zeros (Sign changes in f(x)) 

f(x) = +x⁵ - 2x⁴ + 3x³ + x² - 5x + 1. 4 sign changes. Possible positive zeros: 4, 2, or 0.

Negative Zeros (Sign changes in f(-x)) 

f(-x) = -x⁵ - 2x⁴ - 3x³ + x² + 5x + 1. 1 sign change. Possible negative zeros: 1.

Note: Remind students that the number of positive/negative zeros must decrease by an even number (2, 4, etc.), and the total of all zeros must always equal the degree of the polynomial.
